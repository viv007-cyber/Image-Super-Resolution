# Image-Super-Resolution
Image super-resolution (SR) aims to enhance low-resolution images to high-resolution quality. This paper explores the effectiveness of ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) on a dataset of 80 paired low- and high-resolution images, comparing its performance to benchmark models on a test set.

ESRGAN utilizes Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks (RRDB)—excluding batch normalization—for efficient feature learning. It incorporates a relativistic GAN, where the discriminator estimates the relative realness of images instead of absolute values. The model optimizes a perceptual loss composed of adversarial loss (driving outputs toward the natural image manifold) and content loss (prioritizing perceptual similarity over pixel-wise accuracy).

Despite a limited training dataset, fine-tuning allowed ESRGAN to outperform benchmarks, generating more realistic textures and higher-quality outputs for single-image super-resolution.


I propose 2 results one with high perceptual quality but low PSNR and SSIM value and one with high pixel accuracy and low perceptual quality

# Evaluation through other models
Our model has performed very well as compared to the standard models used in this field and can produce even better results.
